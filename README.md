This is a calculator for the game Old School Runescape.

It estimates how much crafting XP you can get by using your stardust to purchase Gem Bags. It also shows you how much the gems would be worth as well as how much the soft clay would be worth if you were to buy that instead and sell it to the Grand Exchange.
